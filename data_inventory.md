*NOTE: need to come up with a workflow for gathering data from the various data explorer tools

1. CDC’s National Environmental Public Health Tracking Network

    - limitations:  

2. Tracking California
    - home page: https://trackingcalifornia.org/topics#gsc.tab=0 
    
    - access method: can download data from the data explorer for each of the topics in the url above. For example, heat-related illness data explorer: https://data.trackingcalifornia.org/?area=ncdm_hri&event=HRED&type=AR100K&sex=TOTL&age=TOTL&race=TOTL&year=2022&co= 

    - licensing:

    - limitations: are provided in each data explorer. For example, the heat-related illness data has the following limitations
        
        Data Collection Purpose - Diagnosis codes are recorded by hospitals for reimbursement purposes and not for public health surveillance.
        The rates provided include ED visits and hospitalizations for California residents. Out-of-state residents and unhoused patients with no recorded address are excluded from the rates.
        Low-level of resolution- Hospitals are not mandated to report patient addresses. The level of geographic resolution of the data is limited to state, county, and zip code.
        Heat stress can manifest in a number of clinical outcomes, and people with chronic health problems (e.g., cardiovascular disease, diabetes, obesity) are more susceptible to the e ects of heat than healthy individuals. This measure does not capture the full spectrum of heat stress, where exposure to excess heat is not explicitly documented.


3. EDF/Texas A&M/Darkhorse’s U.S. Climate Vulnerability Index

- access method: can access/download excel file from here https://climatevulnerabilityindex.org/cvi-data/ or their github: https://github.com/wachiuphd/CVI
