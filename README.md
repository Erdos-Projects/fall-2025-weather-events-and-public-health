# Beating the Heat: Building Heat Resilience in California
**Team project:** `fall-2025-weather-events-and-public-health`

**Entrypoint:** Run `__main__.py` to view EDA and regression results and plots.

**Research question:** Which built environment indicators (e.g., percent of residential areas with AC, parks and greenspaces, tree cover) have the most influence on heat-related illnesses and deaths during heatwaves for different regions in California?

**Unit of analysis:** percent or fraction per capita of built environment indicators and corresponding rate of heat-related illnesses, hospitalizations, and deaths.

**Scope and boundaries:** Geographically restricted to California regions that are separated by either zip code, neighborhood, or county. Time horizon is not restricted as of now. There is no population restriction. We're not including demographic or health features.

**Anti-goals:** We're not going to address individual health, race, sex, or other sociodemographic features since we're trying to single out the impact of infrastructure on heat illness and deaths.

### What decision or action will this analysis inform?

Deciding what resources and infrastructure that should be prioritized in each community to minimize heat-related illnesses and deaths during a heatwave.

### Who are the stakeholders and what do they care about?
The stakeholders would be the general public, local decision-makers (e.g. city councils), and government officials (e.g. state representatives). They should care about building resilient communities to protect the well-being of everyone or at least the economic productivity of workers (outdoor, healthcare, retail) in excessive heat.
